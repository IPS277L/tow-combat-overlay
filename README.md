## Controls

### Tokens Panel

![Tokens Panel](assets/readme/tokens-panel.png)

The Tokens Panel provides a quick, readable view of everyone in the scene at the top of the screen. It makes switching between tokens much faster, and it can be arranged with saved order and panel position

### Token Layout

![Token Layout](assets/readme/token-layout.png)

Token Layout adds lightweight visuals directly on tokens, so key information stays in place. Names, borders, and status elements are easier to read in busy scenes, and dead-state visuals help make the scene state clear at a glance

### Control Panel

![Control Panel](assets/readme/control-panel.png)

The Control Panel keeps commonly used actor actions, attacks, and info in one place, reducing the need to jump between sheets. It is built for fast scene flow, including ranged weapon reload and common magic flows, with enough settings to fit different table preferences
